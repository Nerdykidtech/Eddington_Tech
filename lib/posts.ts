    content: `Here's what keeps me up at night in IAM: the moment you think you've contained a breach. That's usually when the real access is already set up and you just don't know it yet.

PamDOORa is a new Linux backdoor discovered by Flare.io researchers, currently being sold on the Rehub Russian cybercrime forum for $900. It's a PAM-based post-exploitation toolkit — meaning it gets deployed AFTER an attacker already has root on a system. Its job is to harvest credentials from every user authenticating through the compromised host, and provide a magic password for persistent SSH access whenever the attacker wants it.

PAM is the Pluggable Authentication Module — the standard auth framework on Linux and Unix systems. Admins like it because you can swap authentication methods without rewriting apps. But here's the catch that doesn't get enough attention: PAM modules run with root privileges, and they don't hash passwords — they transmit plaintext during the auth handshake. Drop a malicious module into that stack and you own every credential that touches the system.

PamDOORa does exactly that. It intercepts SSH authentication attempts, logs the results, and has anti-forensic capabilities to manipulate authentication logs and erase traces. The researchers described it as "operator-grade tooling" — modular, with anti-debugging features and network-aware triggers. That's not a script some kid threw together. That's a product with a support team.

This is a post-breach problem, not a zero-day. The initial infection chain still requires an attacker to get root through some other means. But that's exactly what makes PAM backdoors dangerous in an enterprise environment. They don't replace your foothold — they amplify it. You patch your SSH config, rotate your keys, enforce fail2ban. And then someone with root drops PamDOORa into the PAM stack, and now every authentication on that host feeds credentials back to the attacker. Rotation doesn't help if the attacker is reading credentials as they fly through the auth stack. Once a PAM backdoor is in place, your "remediated" server is still compromised. You rebuild, not rotate.

The practical thing: PAM module integrity is an afterthought at most shops. File integrity monitoring on /etc/pam.d/ and /lib/security/ should be standard practice, not optional. If you're not tracking what PAM modules are loaded, you're missing a real part of your authentication surface.

PamDOORa isn't confirmed in the wild yet. But it's for sale for $900, down from $1,600 in March — which tells you the market is there and the sellers are motivated. Assume it's being deployed somewhere right now.

I work across identity & access management, infrastructure hardening, and iOS development. Those three worlds don't intersect publicly very often — IAM people blog about zero trust, infra people blog about Terraform, iOS devs blog about SwiftUI. This blog is where I'll try to bridge those gaps and share what I'm actually thinking about as I work.

New post every day. Short, signal-heavy, no fluff.`,

    excerpt: "ShinyHunters hit Instructure's Canvas LMS. Here's the IAM angle that's being missed in most coverage.",
    category: "Security",
    readTime: "4 min",
    content: `The Canvas breach is the kind of story that makes IAM engineers feel vindicated and nauseated at the same time.

Brian Krebs broke it today: ShinyHunters hit Instructure's Canvas platform — the LMS used by roughly 9,000 schools and 275 million students and faculty. They defaced the login page with a ransom demand. Instructure's status page called it "scheduled maintenance." It wasn't.

The data stolen includes names, email addresses, student ID numbers, and apparently billions of private messages between students and teachers. No passwords or financial data — Instructure made sure to get that message out early. Understandable, but it also tells you exactly what they knew wasn't compromised.

What caught my eye wasn't the scale. It was the ransom model. ShinyHunters told each affected school to negotiate separately. That's deliberate: instead of negotiating with Instructure, they went straight to the institutions. Schools with finals this week had real pressure. That's not an accident.

The IAM angle here is simple and most schools still aren't handling it right:

- Student IDs and email addresses get treated as low-sensitivity. They shouldn't be. They're the pivot point for every phishing, social engineering, and account takeover attack targeting a student population with basically no security training.
- 275 million people includes minors. FERPA doesn't disappear because a ransomware group is asking the questions.
- MFA enforcement at institutional level is still inconsistent across K-12 and higher ed. A Canvas breach with 2FA on every account looks very different than one without.

What I keep thinking about: how did ShinyHunters get in the first place? Instructure said they'd patched and contained it. Then on May 7th, the login page was defaced anyway. Either the patch was incomplete, or they re-entered through a different vector. Neither is acceptable.

The Cloudskope CEO called out Instructure for lying about "scheduled maintenance" while schools were being actively extorted. Fair criticism. But from where I'm sitting, the harder question is why a platform with data on 275 million people didn't have controls that would make a breach less catastrophic — or why those controls weren't being audited regularly.

If you're running Canvas at your institution: treat this as a reason to push for MFA enforcement on student accounts, not just faculty. The blast radius of a student email breach isn't zero.

More as it develops.
